# XUMM Issue Tracker

As the XUMM ecosystem relies on a combination of code repositories (App, Developer Console, etc.) this central repository will be used to centrally track bugs, improvements, suggestions &amp; release progress (using Projects & Project Boards).

For end user support, or to learn more about contributing (eg. translating) and for XUMM Developer Resources, [please visit the FAQ](https://support.xumm.app/en/).
